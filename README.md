 Task 2: Customer Support Data Analysis & Ticket Resolution

In this task, I focused on analyzing customer support ticket data to uncover frequently reported issues and identify ways to improve response efficiency.

How I achieved this:

Used Python (Pandas) to clean and organize the dataset, enabling efficient exploration of ticket content.

Applied NLTK for basic text analysis to categorize and group similar issues reported by customers.

Created summary tables and visualizations in Excel to highlight trends such as most common complaints, peak reporting times, and ticket resolution patterns.

Identified repetitive issues and bottlenecks in the resolution process and documented actionable insights to improve support workflows.

Compiled a summary report detailing common customer pain points and recommendations for automating or streamlining support processes.

Key Takeaways:

Learned how to categorize large volumes of unstructured text data from support tickets.

Improved my problem-solving skills by translating data patterns into process improvement strategies.

Gained practical experience using Python for text mining and Excel for business reporting.

ðŸ’¡ Insight: Automating responses for the top 5 most common issues could significantly reduce response time and improve customer satisfaction.
